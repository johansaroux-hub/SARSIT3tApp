6.5 IT3 Schedule T Data Submission 
 
This section lists all the fields that are required for the IT3 Schedule T file. The table specifies for each field, the required length, provides a 
description and indicates the relevant validation rules. 
 
Note 1: The number column is used to reference fields in the table for ease of use and does not indicate sequence in the file. 
Note 2  

 M = Mandatory: Implying the field must always be completed 
 C = Conditional: Implying the field must always be completed under the defined conditions, else it can be left blank 
 O = Optional: Implying the field can be completed if possible 
 MW = Mandatory with warning: Implying from a SARS perspective this field is mandatory (as defined above), however due to constraints 

experienced by the submitting entities to provide the required data, the field can be left blank for a pre-defined time period and SARS will 
accept a record where such a mandatory field has not been completed. At the applicable time the field will revert to the intended Mandatory 
type and at such time SARS will reject the records if not completed. 

 CW = Conditional with warning: Implying that from a SARS perspective, when the conditions are met, this field is mandatory, however due to 
constraints experienced by the submitting entities to provide the required data, the field can be left blank for a pre-defined time period and 
SARS will accept a record where such a field has not been completed under the specified conditions. At the applicable time the field will 
revert to the intended mandatory type when the conditions are met and at such time SARS will reject the records if not completed. 

Note 3 IX (Fixed) in order to save space. 
Note 4: Bulk or Real Time submissions: 

 Fields marked with Bulk (B) is for submissions via eFiling, HTTPS or C:D.   
 Fields marked with Real Time (R) is for submissions via API process (this implementation is for a future phase  not applicable to this BRS). 
 Fields can be identified as B/R too, which makes both applicable.

Note 5: In order to enhance the readability and understanding of some of the complex validations, some Field names used has been replaced with 
characters, e.g. Submission Tax Year (Field 24) = X.  Where this has been done, the list of field names replaced will appear at the start of the 
validation.  The same character has not necessarily been used throughout for the same field name. 
Note 6: File name definition  Refer to the file name structure table under Section 5 / 6. 
Note 7: The IT3-02 declaration will be processed by the Submitting Entity (SE)  and not on the Reporting Entity (RE) level. 
Note 8: All monetary values are in South African Rand.

7.10 Appendix I - Modulus 10 Validation
7.10.1 Income Tax and Value Added 

The last character is a check digit, calculated by applying the following algorithm: 

Digit Formula 
Digit 1 Multiply by 2 (Add result to total)*  See below 
Digit 2 Add to total 
Digit 3 Multiply by 2 (Add result to total)*  See below 
Digit 4 Add to total 
Digit 5 Multiply by 2 (Add result to total)*  See below 
Digit 6 Add to total 
Digit 7 Multiply by 2 (Add result to total)*  See below 
Digit 8 Add to total 
Digit 9 Multiply by 2 (Add result to total)*  See below 

* When the result of the line item calculation exceeds 9, add the individual digits together to obtain a 
single digit result (e.g. 18 = 1+ 8 = 9) 

Digit 10:  Check digit 
If the last digit of Total > 0 Then 

The Check Digit should be equal to the result of 10  (Total MOD 10) 
If the last digit of Total = 0 Then 

The Check Digit should be equal to zero 

Example: 
Tax Reference Number = 0001339050 

Digit Formula Result 
Digit 1 0 x 2 0 
Digit 2 0 + 0 
Digit 3 0 x 2 + 0 
Digit 4 1 + 1 
Digit 5 3 x 2 + 6 
Digit 6 3 + 3 
Digit 7 9 x 2 = 18 (1 + 8 = 9) + 9 
Digit 8 0 + 0 
Digit 9 5 x 2 = 10 (1 + 0 = 1) + 1 
Total 20 

Last Digit of Total is not greater than zero 0 so the check digit equal 0 and the number is therefore 
valid. 
7.10.2 Pay As You Earn 

The last character is a check digit, calculated by applying the following algorithm: 
 

SARS_External BRS_2022_IT3s_v4.0.0T-9                                                                                                 Page 274 of 282     



Digit Formula
Digit 1 Replace character 1 with a 4, then multiply by 2 (Add 

result to total)*  See below 
Digit 2 Add to total 
Digit 3 Multiply by 2 (Add result to total)*  See below 
Digit 4 Add to total 
Digit 5 Multiply by 2 (Add result to total)*  See below 
Digit 6 Add to total 
Digit 7 Multiply by 2 (Add result to total)*  See below 
Digit 8 Add to total 
Digit 9 Multiply by 2 (Add result to total)*  See below 

 
* When the result of the line item calculation exceeds 9, add the individual digits together to obtain a 
single digit result (e.g. 18 = 1+ 8 = 9) and add this to this to the total (See example below) 

Digit 10:  Check digit 
Then determine the value of 90 minus the Total value calculated above, then 
The Check Digit (character 10) equals the right most value of the number  

Example: 

PAYE Reference Number = 7020705408 
 

Digit Formula Result 
Digit 1 4 x 2 8 
Digit 2 0 + 0 
Digit 3 2 x 2 + 4 
Digit 4 0 + 0 
Digit 5 7 x 2 = 14 (1+4 = 5) + 5 
Digit 6 0 + 0 
Digit 7 5 x 2 = 10 (1 + 0 = 1) + 1 
Digit 8 4 + 4 
Digit 9 0 x 2 + 0 
Total 22 

 
90  22 = 68. Therefore the right most value equals 8. The check digit (character 10) equals 8; 
therefore the PAYE reference number is valid.

7.11 Appendix J ID Validation
Format: 
{YYMMDD}{G}{SSS}{C}{A}{Z} 
YYMMDD : Date of birth. 
G  : Gender. 0-4 Female; 5-9 Male. 
SSS  : Sequence No. for DOB/G combination. 
C  : Citizenship. 0 SA; 1 Other. 
A  : Usually 8, or 9 [can be other values] 
Z  : Control digit 

Formula to calculate the check digit for a 13 digit identity number: 
According to the provisions of the Identification Amendment Act, 2000 (Act No. 28 of 2000, which 
was promulgated on 13 October 2000) all forms of identity documents other than the green bar-
coded identity document are invalid.   In accordance with the legislation, the control figure which is 
the 13th digit of all identity numbers which is calculated as follows using ID Number 800101 5009 
087 as an example: 
Add all the digits in the odd positions (excluding last digit).  8 + 0 + 0 + 5 + 0 + 0 = 13...................[1]  
Move the even positions into a field and multiply the number by 2. 

011098 x 2 = 22196  
Add the digits of the result in b). 

2 + 2 + 1 + 9 + 6 = 20.........................[2]  
Add the answer in [2] to the answer in [1]. 

13 + 20 = 33  
Subtract the second digit (i.e. 3) from 10.  The number must tally with the last number in the ID 
Number. If the result is 2 digits, the last digit is used to compare against the last number in the ID 
Number.  If the answer differs, the ID number is invalid

7.13 Appendix L - MD5 Calculation
The following calculation must be used for determining the file hash total.

Figure 1.One MD5 operation. MD5 consists of 64 of these operations, grouped in four rounds of 16 
operations. F is a nonlinear function; one function is used in each round. Mi denotes a 32-bit block 
of the message input, and Ki denotes a 32-bit constant, different for each operation. s denotes a 
left bit rotation by s places; s varies for each operation. denotes addition modulo 232.

MD5 processes a VAR-length message into a FIX-length output of 128 bits. The input message is 
broken up into chunks of 512-bit blocks (sixteen 32-bit little endian integers); the message is padded
so that its length is divisible by 512. The padding works as follows: first a single bit, 1, is appended 
to the end of the message. This is followed by as many zeros as are required to bring the length of 
the message up to 64 bits fewer than a multiple of 512. The remaining bits are filled up with a 64-bit 
little endian integer representing the length of the original message, in bits.

The main MD5 algorithm operates on a 128-bit state, divided into four 32-bit words, denoted A, B, C
and D. These are initialized to certain FIX constants. The main algorithm then operates on each 
512-bit message block in turn, each block modifying the state. The processing of a message block 
consists of four similar stages, termed rounds; each round is composed of 16 similar operations 
based on a non-linear function F, modular addition, and left rotation. Figure 1 illustrates one 
operation within a round. There are four possible functions F; a different one is used in each round:

denote the XOR, AND, OR and NOT operations respectively.

The MD5 hash is calculated according to this algorithm:

Note: Instead of the formulation from the original RFC 1321 shown, the following may be used for 
improved efficiency (useful if assembly language is being used - otherwise, the compiler will 
generally optimize the above code. Since each computation is dependent on another in these 
formulations, this is often slower than the above method where the nand/and can be parallelised): 

xor (b and (c xor d)) 
xor (d and (b xor c))
